### Ho to use

#### Indicator based Filter IBF

This filter allows identifying which PWS have erronous data compared to their neighboring stations, especially for intense precipitation events.
As neighboring stations, as trust worthy network should be used. In our work we used the German Weather Service (DWD) network as a primary network.

For every PWS station, select the dry season period (April-October), find which primary network stations are the nearest and consider the time period where the stations have data availability for at least 2 month. Using a percentile thershold (for example the 99 percentile), find for each station the corresponding rainfall value (pcp_thr). Convert the time series to boolean timeseries (1 if above pcp_thr, else 0). Calculate the correlation value between the PWS and the neighboring primary network station, as well as the primary network stations. If the correlation between the PWS-primary network is similar to the correlation of the primary network stations, keep the PWS else remove it.

Note: this filter is done for every PWS seperatly, therefore it is run in parrallel.

**Corresponsing code**

****Required Input****
  1. Hdf5 data file containing the PWS station data, the corresponding timestamps and their corresponding coordinates, in a metric coordinate system
  2. Hdf5 data file containing the primary network station data, the corresponding timestamps and their corresponding coordinates, in a metric coordinate system (same as PWS)
****Output****
  1. A dataframe containing mainly the correlation values between each PWS and the corresponding neighboring station data, and the correlation between the neighboring primary network stations .
  2. The final result is obtained by keeping all the PWS where the correlation between PWS and primary network is greater or equal to the correlation between the primary network stations.
